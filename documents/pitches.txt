Pitch 1: Music streaming today allows for users to constantly update and organize all of their favorite artists’ music. 
A lot of times it’s not easy to find the most current and local live shows by your favorite artists without having to do 
some independent searching. This application would allow users to authenticate their Spotify or Apple Music libraries, 
and the application would sift through all of their playlists and music preferences. From there, it will search for local
shows and events that feature the artists in the users library, as well as suggestions of shows that are similar to
their music taste. From there, the application will also interact with multiple ticketing applications to provide the 
best prices available for all the events found as well as direct links to the ticketing websites for booking purposes.
The application will use a database to store the shows you’ve attended so the user can review history of the shows they’ve 
attended.
