User story: As a user, I should be able to authenticate the music library of my choice upon login.

Summary: The user, upon entry into the web application and after account registration (from story 1) will be 
given the option to authenticate either their Apple Music Library or their Spotify Library. From there,
the user must enter their personal credentials for this. If credentials are entered successfully, then the 
user will gain access to the web application. If credentials are entered unsuccessfully, the user will be asked 
to reenter the credentials until they are entered correctly.
