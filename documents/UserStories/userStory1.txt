User Story: 

As a user, I should be able to create a personal account on the web application.

Summary: 

The user, upon first accessing the web application will be asked to either login to their account 
or create a new account. If the user has an account, then the user will login with proper credentials. 
If credentials are correct, then user is logged into the web application. If credentials are incorrect, 
the user will be prompted again, or (offered option to reset password?). New users will be given option 
to create a new account with basic information to fill in. If information is missing from signup form, 
the user will be asked to be sure to input all necessary information.
